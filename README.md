# PizzaSales_Data_Analytics
I'm excited to share my latest project where I dived deep into an Pizza sales dataset to extract valuable business insights. Through this project, I honed my data cleaning and transformation skills, ensuring the dataset was primed for analysis. Leveraging SQL, I queried the data to uncover key trends and patterns, and then visualized these insights using a comprehensive Power BI dashboard. The dashboard highlights sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends, providing actionable insights for business decisions.

This project not only sharpened my technical skills in SQL and Power BI but also reinforced the importance of data-driven decision-making in todayâ€™s business landscape. I'm looking forward to applying these skills in real-world scenarios and continuing to grow in the field of data analytics.
